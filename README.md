# gpt-jargon

## What is it?

Jargon is a natural language programming language (or, psuedolanguage) that is specified and interpreted by LLMs like GPT-4. The purpose of Jargon is to create a *little bit* more structure to make procedural programming of LLMs just more precise than simply using natural language. If traditional programming languages are really strict, and naturally asking an LLM to perform a task in natural language is really "loose", then using Jargon falls somewhere in the middle.

## Examples of Jargon

An empty Jargon program. Every Jargon program has to begin and end with `+++`.

```
+++
+++
```

Jargon programs can be specified in natural language and execute instructions procedurally:

```
+++
- Think of a random number between 1 and 10.
- Take this number and multiply it by 2.
- Output the result.
+++
```
